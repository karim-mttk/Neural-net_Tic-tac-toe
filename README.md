# Neural-network: Tic-tac-toe
In this repository, you'll find a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game enhanced with the power of a neural network. The neural network serves as the core of the game's artificial intelligence, enabling it to make strategic moves and learn from its gameplay experiences.

The game is designed to provide an engaging and challenging experience for players, as the neural network-driven AI adapts and improves its gameplay over time. This project is an excellent example of how machine learning can be incorporated into traditional games to create dynamic and enjoyable experiences for users.

To get started with this project, simply follow the installation and setup instructions provided in the README file. You'll then be able to enjoy playing against the AI or even use the source code as a foundation for your own machine learning projects.

Feel free to contribute to the project, report any issues, or suggest new features to enhance the game further. Enjoy the game ;)
