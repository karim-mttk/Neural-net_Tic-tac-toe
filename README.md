# Neural-network: Tic-tac-toe
In this repository, you'll find a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game which I am trying to enhanced with the power of a neural network. 
The neural network serves as the core of the game's artificial intelligence, enabling it to make strategic moves and learn from its gameplay experiences.
This project is in its developmental phase, as I am trying to train the model with neural network.
